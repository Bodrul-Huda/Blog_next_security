    "image": "/ai.jpeg",
    "content": "AT AN OLD biscuit factory in South London, giant mixers and industrial ovens have been replaced by robotic arms, incubators, and DNA sequencing machines. James Field and his company LabGenius aren’t making sweet treats; they’re cooking up a revolutionary, AI-powered approach to engineering new medical antibodies. In nature, antibodies are the body’s response to disease and serve as the immune system’s front-line troops. They’re strands of protein that are specially shaped to stick to foreign invaders so that they can be flushed from the system. Since the 1980s, pharmaceutical companies have been making synthetic antibodies to treat diseases like cancer, and to reduce the chance of transplanted organs being rejected. But designing these antibodies is a slow process for humans—protein designers must wade through the millions of potential combinations of amino acids to find the ones that will fold together in exactly the right way, and then test them all experimentally, tweaking some variables to improve some characteristics of the treatment while hoping that doesn’t make it worse in other ways. “If you want to create a new therapeutic antibody, somewhere in this infinite space of potential molecules sits the molecule you want to find,” says Field, the founder and CEO of LabGenius.",

    "title": "The slippery quest to invent a safer, more effective sunscreen",
    "image": "/sunscreem.jpeg",
    "content": "I GREW up in Queensland, Australia, which is, to put it mildly, a very sunny place – and, to put it bluntly, the skin cancer capital of the world, with a higher incidence per capita than anywhere else. As a pale-skinned person, I have experienced a blistering case of sunburn more times than I would like to admit and I know that for Caucasian people, even one instance more than doubles the risk of getting melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Sunscreen, then, is my constant friend. Lately, however, I have been worrying that being sun-smart may have unintended consequences. I have heard that the chemicals in sunscreen could be harming coral reefs, and maybe even our own health. So I was curious – not only about the extent to which these concerns are really justified, but also whether science is any closer to producing safer and more effective sun creams. I found that although the evidence for sunscreen’s harmful effects is patchy and conflicting, a new generation of preparations is emerging from laboratories. Many are based on compounds found in algae, plants and even coral, and they are being formulated in ways that promises to solve the problems with today’s products. In one case at least, there is even the prospect of a sunscreen you truly won’t have to laboriously reapply throughout the day.",

    "title": "Does space-time remember? The search for gravitational memory",
    "image": "/spaceTime.jpeg",
    "content": "WHEN black holes collide in the distant reaches of the universe, they release energy in the form of gravitational waves. You can picture these passing through space-time like the ripples a dropped pebble creates on the surface of a pond. “In a pond, after the ripples pass, the water returns to its old level,” says David Garfinkle, a cosmologist at Oakland University in Michigan. You might imagine that after the gravitational wave has passed, the fabric of the universe returns to normal too. “But it doesn’t,” says Garfinkle. In fact, Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which says that gravity results from mass warping space-time, predicts that gravitational waves should ever-so-subtly shift the structure of space-time in their wake. In other words, the universe remembers. This “gravitational memory” effect is so weak that it might as well be homeopathic. But, in recent years, a few optimistic astrophysicists have taken up the challenge of trying to demonstrate its existence. “They hedge their bets about when,” says Andrew Strominger, a theoretical physicist at Harvard University, “but nobody’s saying we can’t measure it.” And now, as more gravitational waves roll in, we might be on the cusp of a breakthrough.",

    "image": "/pacific.jpeg",
    "content": "FOR years, climate models have predicted that as greenhouse gas emissions rise, ocean waters will warm. For the most part, they have been correct. Yet in a patch of the Pacific Ocean, the opposite is happening. Stretching west from the coast of Ecuador for thousands of kilometres lies a tentacle of water that has been cooling for the past 30 years. Why is this swathe of the eastern Pacific defying our predictions? Welcome to the mystery of the cold tongue. This isn’t just an academic puzzle. Pedro DiNezio at the University of Colorado Boulder calls it “the most important unanswered question in climate science”. The trouble is that not knowing why this cooling is happening means we also don’t know when it will stop, or whether it will suddenly flip over into warming. This has global implications. The future of the cold tongue could determine whether California is gripped by permanent drought or Australia by ever-deadlier wildfires. It influences the intensity of monsoon season in India and the chances of famine in the Horn of Africa. It could even alter the extent of climate change globally by tweaking how sensitive Earth’s atmosphere is to rising greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "title": "Sewage crisis: The truth about British rivers and how to clean them up",
    "image": "/sewer.jpeg",
    "content": "TENS of metres under central London a tunnel has been dug that stretches 25 kilometres at a cost of £4.3 billion. Boring was completed in April 2022 and the passage should start operation in 2025. The 7.2-metre-wide Thames Tideway won’t carry people or vehicles though, but sewage. This “super sewer” will collect the huge volumes of stormwater and waste that often overwhelm London’s ageing sewage system. Instead of being dumped into the Thames estuary, as happens now, the effluent will gush through the new tunnel to Europe’s largest sewage treatment works at Beckton, on the outskirts of the city. The Thames Tideway is the most conspicuous example of the UK’s attempts to stop dumping sewage into rivers, amid growing outrage towards the privatised water companies responsible for the waste system. But this new infrastructure is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to solving this crisis, which is linked to wider issues of how water is managed and even climate change. The good news is that technical solutions already exist, many of which are win-wins: helping to solve sewage overflows as well as problems such as flooding and drought.",
